Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is outstanding, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) And only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take results-oriented steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.",Machine Learning Engineer,Bengaluru,4.3,₹500+ billion (INR), 1164777,Information Technology,10000+ employees,Company - Private,0,0, 1164777

Why Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) And only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take results-oriented steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Skills/Competencies:

Communication: Data scientists must communicate effectively up and down the data supply chain: first, to obtain access to the data they require; second, to work with those who understand the business meaning behind the data; and third, to articulate findings and implications to business leaders in language they understand. A data scientist must be able to use data to tell stories. Key components of these communication skills are those of persuasion and expectation management. The ability to insert themselves into core business functions and assert their ideas is therefore critical.

Collaboration: Working directly for business leaders and side-by-side with business unit personnel, they need to shed the introverted statistician stereotype. Increasingly, business professionals require access to analytic techniques beyond basic math and must be able to rely on the data scientist to work closely with them. The data scientist enables the broad consumerization of derivative result sets and analytics (if not the raw data). The data scientist must have the ability to juggle competing priorities and pressures.

Leadership. The role of the data scientist can incorporate data oversight responsibilities including directing the efforts of teams of consultant statisticians, data administration and integration professionals, and data visualization, reporting, and application integration developers.

Creativity. The work of the data scientist is very much an innovation-oriented exercise in solving open-ended conundrums. Data scientists are tasked with finding opportunities to optimize, expand or transform the business through the lens of information. Moreover, data scientists must be creative in sourcing data, modeling problems and employing a range of analytic techniques.

Discipline. Although creativity is critical, data scientists must remember that ""science"" is part of their directive. This means following established scientific methods, employing legitimate techniques, using valid data and embracing causality. Scientific methods demand that questions are well-defined, true data (observations) is collected, and hypotheses are formed, investigative methods are selected, data is analyzed and interpreted with yielding conclusions, and results are formally communicated and tested. Although rigid methodology is recommended, results perfection is not. Business opportunity costs in a fast-paced marketplace are too high to spend excessive time achieving incrementally better analyses. However, a data scientist — just as any good statistician or other analytics professional — must understand the differences between correlation and causality and between incidental and insightful patterns.

Passion: An obsession for information, solving insurmountable problems and finding unique ways to accelerate the business.

Consultancy: Manages provision of specialist knowledge over a range of topics in data science including the role of IT in the business; in own areas of expertise provides advice and guidance influencing the effectiveness of the organization’s business processes.

Data Design: Controls analytics data design practice within the enterprise. Influences industry-based models for the development of new technology applications. Develops effective implementation and procurement strategies, consistent with business needs.

Data Analysis: Sets standards for advanced analytics tool usage and techniques, advises on their application, and ensures compliance. Manages the investigation of corporate data requirements, and co-ordinates the application of data analysis and analytics techniques, based upon a detailed understanding of the corporate information requirements, in order to establish, modify or maintain analytical models and their associated components.

Autonomy: Has authority and responsibility for all aspects of data science, including policy formation and application. Is fully accountable for actions taken and decisions made, both by self and subordinates.

Influence: Makes decisions critical to organizational success. Influences developments within the IT industry at the highest levels. Advances the knowledge and/or exploitation of IT within one or more organizations. Develops long-term strategic relationships with customers, partners, industry leaders and government.

Complexity: Performs highly complex work activities covering technical, financial and quality aspects. Contributes to the formulation and implementation of IT strategy. Creatively applies a wide range of technical and/or management principles.

Business Skills Absorbs complex technical information and communicates effectively at all levels to both technical and non-technical audiences. Assesses and evaluates risk. Understands the implications of new technologies. Demonstrates clear leadership and the ability to influence and persuade. Has a broad understanding of all aspects of IT and deep understanding of own specialism(s). Understands and communicates the role and impact of IT in the employing organization and promotes compliance with relevant legislation. Takes the initiative to keep both own and subordinates' skills up to date and to maintain an awareness of developments in the IT industry.

"Atom
3.7",-1,2007,"Coimbatore, India",IT Services,"Hi,

This is Samvid, co-founder and product lead. I wanted this to be a bit informal, so I'm just gonna talk here instead of creating a document.

Job Location: Gurgaon, Currently Remote due to Coronavirus Indefinitely

Compensation: 0 - 10,000/month

Our Vision

We're looking to recruit for the core team of our funded startup.

Less than 1% of people complete their New Year's resolution. Less than 9% do something about it after the first week.

We believe that the main challenge of our times is self-regulation and self discipline. For this, technology should be a solution and not the primary cause for distractions. We want to tackle this by using behavioural psychology, AI & games to help achieve our goals through small, byte sized habits.

Learn more about our product & vision here : http://bit.ly/AtmVsn

Who We Are

We have experience in building products as a core part of other startups (nearbuy, Limetray) and have used these opportunities to understand how to build technology businesses from the grounds-up. Gaurav and I are founders, and batchmates from NSIT CS, batch of 2013.

Who We Are Looking For

We are a team of about 5 right now and are looking to expand to 15. We need people across product, engineering and design. The way we see everyone's role at Atom is that everyone has a core competency which will be their primary responsibility, beyond which, each person has the right to choose to do more than just their role. We distribute tasks democratically and we will continue to do that as part of our culture.

Why should you join ?

The main takeaway for people wouldn't be the pay, if money is in your top three motivations to apply, I would discourage you from applying. We are at a point where we want to figure out product-market fit and as part of a small organisation you learn how to do that. Additionally, you will learn how to build and launch a consumer product for the western market, how to setup a team for a startup and more ownership in your field of work. Unless these aren't your priority, or if our vision doesn't appeal to you I would recommend against this profile.

Interview Process

We do this quite differently, for reasons that seem obvious to us. Basis your CV, we will have a video-call. Post that, we usually like people to come on board with us for 2-3 weeks and work with us. If you're already working, you can do this on weekends. We've seen this work well for us in previous startups mostly because it really helps us understand each other in terms of vision, culture and how we approach problems. This will definitely be more than an employer-employee relationship and we know that first 5-10 people in a startup are absolutely critical, perhaps even more so than founders. This ""trial"" helps both parties sort of de-risk the process.

If you've made it this far, congratulations. You've more focus than the majority. Let's finally get into the actual day-to-day

Responsibilities

Own and manage what to measure and what data to look out, in order to make the organisation more data-informed
Work to prepare experiments and targets for every product launch
Identifying what to measure, and the best way to do so through tools like Google Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel etc.
Understanding and working with data visualisation tools like tableau to enable teams to take better decision
Desired Skills and Experience

We've been thinking about who we want to work with, and how we want the company culture to be quite deeply. Though this is something that we know will change, we want to make it as explicit. View our values here : http://bit.ly/AtmCltr

Responsibilities

You will be focused on making sure of data correctness and accessibility, and building scalable systems to access/process it. Another major responsibility is helping AI/ML Engineers write better code. You will also build scalable, high performance data intensive services.

Examples:

- We have data pipelines processing aggregate and statistical data. Should we store this

in Redshift, in flat files in S3, or somewhere else?

- How should we structure our data pipelines?

- We need to track various data points to identify our customers in various locations, including from different devices, and determine that two seemingly disparate users are actually the same. How can we do this efficiently and effectively?

Your job is to understand what we’re trying to build, make informed choices about this and then get us going.

Example interview questions:

- Consider the query `SELECT * FROM foo INNER JOIN bar ON foo.x = bar.x WHERE foo.primary_key = ?`. What happens if you run this in Postgres? How does that differ if you run it in Redshift, or SparkSQL?

- Suppose we store a table in flat CSV files on S3. What kinds of jobs is this good for, and bad for? How is Parquet or BerkeleyDB different?

- What data structures are good for storing a graph, assuming the common query is finding a connected component?

On these questions, we’re primarily interested in computer science fundamentals. A good answer might be “a B-Tree, with keys structured as ...”. A bad answer might be be “use Neo4J, I don’t know how it works but it’s fast”.",Data Engineer,Bengaluru,4.3,Unknown / Non-Applicable, 15479,Finance,51 to 200 employees,Company - Private,0,1, 15479

"Zeta
4.1",-1,2015,"Bengaluru, India",Internet,"Zeta intends to replace many legacy systems in use by banks for processing payments. Banks need to leapfrog into an era of connected devices and omnipresent commerce. Banking should become an integral part of the commerce and enterprise systems, thereby enabling seamless consumer and business transactions. The average number of interactions an account holder may have with a bank would increase to 12-15 per day in the near term from the current average of 3-4 transactions per month. These could grow to an unimaginably large number in future. Most banking systems aren’t designed for this scale. In many ways, these systems are limiting the imagination of possibilities. We want this changed fundamentally, in an inter-operable and regulatory compliant manner.

We build large-scale transaction processing systems that can work with many current and future payment networks. We build applications that help banks realize the value of this new approach early. We help banks to rapidly deliver the value of these applications to their customers.

4.1","Facebook, Google, WhatsApp",2012,"New Delhi, India",Internet,"A NEW SOCIAL FUTURE ‍‍

How is it that in a world that's evolving so quickly that social products still feel the same? Strangely enough, we're still using products that were invented in the 2G era. There seems to be an emptiness with the current experience and today's products are built to force humanity to be superficial.

We'd like to change that.

With the advancements in technology, so much more is possible today that wasn't even possible, just a few years ago. We believe the timing couldn't be better.

6 PRINCIPLES

We’re thoughtful about why we do things and here are 6 principles guiding our thinking:

Advancements in Tech & AI: Allowing more bits to be pushed to users in real-time and thus allowing far richer, more personalised experiences.
Bits Cheaper than Atoms: Today, bringing rich, luxurious experiences to the masses is faster, more efficient and cheaper online than it is offline.
Self Worth Moving Online: 40% of people's waking life is now spent on their smartphones. The next generation is far more comfortable online than offline.
Vertical Communities: We don't live our lives in one massive community. We're specific in the activities we engage in (art, gaming, fitness etc).
New Business Models: Putting customer at the centre. These won't be ad-driven in the traditional sense. Think micro-transactions, subscriptions and more.
Consumers as Owners: It's a bit strange that consumers aren't part of the value chain. Turning customers into owners is a fascinating thought.

BUILD MAGICAL THINGS

It’s so clear to us that technology evolves but people stay the same. We’re solving for a core human need - social connection and with all the evolution in technology, today we can solve for that in brand new ways.

At our core, we’re a creative company. Ideas and pixels is where we live and we love building magical products that make our users feel ‘wow’ inside. It’s not just about features, it’s also about how they make people feel. We build at the intersection of the scientific and the romantic.

And it all starts with people, the right team that cares deeply about our mission, values and our users. At hike, you'll have the chance to do the best work of your life.

Come join us and shape the future of social.

THE HIKE CODE

We’re on a journey to build something new, something different and making anything innovative & new requires the ability to surrender to the unknown. The Hike Code is our value system. It is our guide to navigate through the unknown to build incredible products. Here they are:

Top Talent in Every Role: We look for people with an incredible intellect. Both skills and values are important to us.
Pro-Sports Team: Strengths based, results driven with a ""team-first"" attitude
Customer at the Centre: Everything we do is inspired by how can we better solve for our customer.
Constant Innovation: It's our DNA to walk into the unknown in search of having meaningful impact.
Act Like Owners: We own the output of what we do, even if it's explicitly not our job.
Thoughtful Decision Making: Clear Mind + Obsession to Simplify + Data Driven. We strive to be thoughtful.
Always be Hustling: We understand that success is not one big leap but tiny gains compounding over time #ABH.
Be Open Minded & Coachable: We have a quest to continuously #RiseUp to be the best version of ourselves.

ROLE & REQUIREMENTS

If you’ve made it till here, then you’re probably interested in the role :)

Key Day to Day Responsibilities:
Perform quantitative analyses that translate data into actionable insights and provide analytical, data-driven decision-making support for key projects.
Provide reporting and performance monitoring to product teams using data drawn from diverse sources.
Own and evangelize data-driven experimentation in the team to improve the product offerings, and document it.
Enable product reviews, deep dives and analyses through the effective use of data and communicate and report insights and recommendations to shape product strategy.
Ensure that any data required for carrying out the other responsibilities for the product/features you’re working on is properly instrumented and logged.
